## Be nice ;)

it’s a good idea to define some rules on how to use the repository before 
working within it - for example what GitHub and coding etiquette should 
people be following? Is there a prefered folder structure, file naming system?

Keep file paths short and sensible.
Don’t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
Always pull before you start working on your project and before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.

Just making another change to commit.
